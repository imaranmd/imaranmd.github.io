### Welcome 

My name is Imran, and currently, I am a Ph.D. student at IITB-Monash Research Academy. My primary research focuses on mimicking the nature of bio-molecules through mathematical and computational modeling. Currently, I am working on modeling the behavior of growing bacterial colonies. These bacterial colonies show different patterns that mainly depends on the medium on which they grow. We have developed a model to study the fundamental processes involved in making these patterns.
